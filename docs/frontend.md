# Frontend

## Webpack

Webpack makes it relatively easy to compile and minify your application's 
CSS and JavaScript files. However, you are not required to use it 
while developing your application; 
you are free to use any asset pipeline tool you wish, or even none at all.

**Installation Instructions:** 

* [Webpack](https://ko-fi.com/s/5f182b4b22) (Slim 4 - eBook Vol. 1)
